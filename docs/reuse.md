# Verified runtime reuse

Four runtime functions were located by comparing symbol-sized, relocation-free
object code from the official [PS2DEV Windows homebrew toolchain release of
2018-10-19](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain/releases/tag/2018-10-19) with the
USA retail executable `SLUS_216.68`. Each byte sequence occurs exactly once in
the executable's `.text` section. This scan tested 123 relocation-free functions
between 24 and 4,096 bytes from `libc.a`, `libm.a`, and `libgcc.a`.

The sources checked into this repository were then independently compiled or
assembled, and their function bytes compared with the retail executable again:

| Symbol | Retail address | Bytes | Reused source | Source form | Verification |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `memcmp` | `0x00393464` | 148 | `src/runtime/memcmp.S` | Upstream assembly | Exact |
| `memcpy` | `0x003934f8` | 172 | `src/runtime/memcpy.S` | Upstream assembly | Exact |
| `memmove` | `0x003935a4` | 252 | `src/runtime/memmove.S` | Upstream assembly | Exact |
| `fabsf` | `0x0037dd58` | 28 | `src/runtime/fabsf.c` | Upstream C | Exact |

The 572 bytes of reused assembly must remain separate from high-level C
decompilation progress. The 28 bytes of compiled `fabsf` C are high-level source.
Function addresses, file offsets, byte hashes, provenance, flags, and source
classification are recorded in `config/runtime_functions.json`.

## Source provenance and licenses

`memcmp.S`, `memcpy.S`, and `memmove.S` are Jeff Johnston's R5900 implementations,
dated February 10, 1999, copyright Cygnus Solutions. Their source notices grant
permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute while preserving the notice.
They were copied without code changes from the added-file hunks of the
[PS2DEV newlib 1.10.0 patch at release
2018-10-19](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2toolchain/blob/2018-10-19/patches/newlib-1.10.0-PS2.patch).
The exact Git blob is `f1971c9a39b37c9d28f80444638aee383d4e48ff`.

`fabsf.c` is an unchanged copy of `newlib/libm/math/sf_fabs.c`, and its companion
`fdlibm.h` is an unchanged copy of `newlib/libm/common/fdlibm.h`, from the official
[newlib 1.10.0 source archive](https://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/newlib-1.10.0.tar.gz).
The source archive SHA-256 is
`69b62ad4c746a9acaf4f898772549f6da49f228f83a95efce7e88ae1d88c5a84`.
These files preserve Sun Microsystems' 1993 permissive copyright notice and the
float-conversion credit to Ian Lance Taylor. The release's complete collection
of license notices is retained in `LICENSES/newlib-1.10.0.txt`. These sources keep
their upstream terms; the project's own tooling license does not replace them.

## Reproducing the tool setup

On Windows, run these commands from the repository root using a working Python
3 interpreter:

```powershell
python tools/bootstrap_toolchain.py
python tools/bootstrap_toolchain.py --verify-only
```

The bootstrap script downloads the two official, openly published tool archives
into the ignored `tools/vendor` directory, verifies their pinned SHA-256 hashes,
and extracts only the needed directories. The Windows built-in `tar.exe` can
read the official PS2DEV `.7z` archive. No machine-wide installation is needed.
The complete download URLs and individual tool hashes are recorded in
`tools/toolchain_manifest.json`.

The binutils v0.10 archive hash was checked against the SHA-256 digest supplied
by GitHub's official release-asset API. The older PS2DEV release has no published
API digest; its official release download was hashed locally and that hash was
pinned for reproducibility. This difference is retained in the manifest.

The candidate compiler is
`tools/vendor/ps2dev-20181019/MinGW/msys/1.0/local/ps2dev/ee/bin/ee-gcc.exe`.
Its DLL dependencies require
`tools/vendor/ps2dev-20181019/MinGW/bin` on the process `PATH`. The compiler's own
`bin` directory should also be on `PATH`. Compile the runtime sources with
`-O2 -G0 -fno-builtin -fno-common -c`; the driver uses the bundled GNU `ee-as`
2.14. The imported assembly relies on that assembler's pseudo-instruction
encodings, so do not silently substitute the modern assembler for these files.
Modern binutils v0.10 is useful for ELF inspection and later baseline assembly.

## Scope of the evidence

These exact runtime matches establish reusable implementations of four specific
functions. They do not identify the compiler used for Papaya's game code, prove
that all newlib/SDK code is the same version, or establish a shared game engine
with any other decompilation. The original compiler remains unidentified.

The ELF contains Havok client identifiers and explicit references to Deimos
tables and `DScriptMgr`. No literal Lua identifier was found in its printable
strings. This makes the game's scripting implementation a research target;
Lua must not be imported solely because its syntax looks similar. No Havok
implementation or proprietary SDK source is copied into this project.

Other useful primary tooling references are [Splat](https://github.com/ethteck/splat)
(MIT; PS2 splitting support), [Ghidra Emotion Engine:
Reloaded](https://github.com/chaoticgd/ghidra-emotionengine-reloaded) (Apache 2.0;
R5900 analysis), and [CCC](https://github.com/chaoticgd/ccc) (MIT; symbol recovery
when debug/linker symbols exist). This executable is stripped, so CCC's debug
type recovery does not presently apply. Their licenses permit appropriate
reuse, but none of their game-function identities are being assumed here.
